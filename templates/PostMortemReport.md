Version: 1.0.1



# Requirements

Starting from the brief description of the application, since the domain is a friendly office, it would be kept as simple as possible, maybe using just a file for storing the information ecc.

# Design

Actually the design has been kepts as simple as possible therefore in any case it will not be thought differently.


# Code and test cases

The way in how the code and test are structured is mandatory, since this is an application between employees in the same office sharing a coffe machine and they will use the application without any training from the developer part, as consequence, it has to be very resilient in terms of possible errors introduced by the users.

# Changes

None.

# Build, tools and environment

A gui test tools should be platform independent, morover, the build should be run during the night otherwise the test performane ( in this case ) are not respected due to the workload of the server.


# Other observations
A previous explanation about build, tools and enviroment would be better in order to understando how to use them.
